The Software Development Kit (SDK) for LabelBox is a set of tools and functions provided by LabelBox to programmatically modify a workspace.

The SDK is used in this project to accomplish the following tasks:
1) Uploading datasets to the project without creating duplicates
2) Queueing batches for each project automatically
3) Filtering the data rows used to create each batch 
4) Exporting labelled data rows
5) Parsing exported data rows to create .csv files

### Working on the SDK:

A guide on working with the SDK is provided on the [LabelBox documentation site](https://docs.labelbox.com/reference/getting-started).

The repository for this project's SDK files is available [here](https://github.com/darwinkjull/TEE-Labelbox-SDK).
