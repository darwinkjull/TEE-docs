This documentation site is designed using the [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) site generator.
The choice to use a website for documentation was made to reduce the complexity of sharing information with external collaborators.
Additionally, it is easy to contribute to the documentation website.

#### How to Update The Site:
1) Clone the project files from the [Github Repository](https://github.com/darwinkjull/TEE-Labelbox-Docs).
2) Make edits to the project files.
    - You can edit and create pages using markdown language. A guide on markdown syntax is provided [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).
    - The files used to create the site's pages are found in the "docs" folder of the project:

    - If you need to make changes to the layout of the site, look at the docusaurus.config.js file. Otherwise, the [docusaurus guides](https://docusaurus.io/docs/category/guides) may be able to help out. 
3) Run the site on your local device and verify it's still working.
4) Push your changes to the source branch.
5) Push your changes to the deployment branch and [deploy the site](https://docusaurus.io/docs/deployment)
