## Joining The Workspace:
Once you have received an invitation to the LabelBox project, you will need to create an account if you do not already have one.
Depending on your permissions, you will have access to one or multiple projects on the LabelBox site.
You can get started with labelling or reviewing right away. Instructions should be provided for whatever step you are working on.

Clarification for instructions can be found in ["Projects and Tasks"](projects-and-tasks).

Detailed documentation on how to use LabelBox can be found on their [official documentation website](https://docs.labelbox.com/docs/).

## Some Definitions:

### Workflow:

**Workspace-** The workspace is where the TEE Labelling project is stored. This includes all of the constituent projects, datasets, ontologies, etc.

**Project-** Each project in the workspace comprises a single step in the workflow. Projects include one labelling task, and at least one reviewing task. A project requires an ontology to apply labels and data rows to apply labels to. 

**Ontology-** An ontology is a set of labels that are to be applied during the labelling step of a project. Different ontologies can share labels.

**Task-** Tasks include labelling and reviewing. Labelling involves applying labels from an ontology to a data row. Reviewing involves approving or rejecting labelled data rows.


### Data:

**Catalog-** The catalog includes all datasets in a workspace.

**Dataset-** A dataset is a set of data rows that has been uploaded to LabelBox.

**Batch-** A batch is a grouping of data rows made from a dataset. 

**Data Row-** A data row is a single data element. In this workspace, a data row is a single video (.mp4 file).

**Label-** A label is an ascribed attribute. Labels in this workspace can include segmentation in space (segmentation mask), segmentation in time (labelling frames), and global labels.
